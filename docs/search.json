    "text": "Confounding Factors and Controlling\nThe statisticians have found that supplement and bench are associated. But they really want to know whether supplement is part of what causes bench.\nWhen two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are found to be associated, there are three possible explanations for the association:\n\n\\(X\\) is part of what causes \\(Y\\);\n\\(Y\\) is part of what causes \\(X\\);\nthere is a third variable \\(Z\\) that is associated with \\(X\\) and which helps to causes \\(Y\\).\n\nIn the third case above, the variable \\(Z\\) is called a confounding factor.\nThe statisticians have recorded the values of workout. They might wonder whether it is a confounding factor.\nWell, it is clearly associated with supplement, as shown here in Table 2:\n\nvitamin_data %&gt;% \n  group_by(supplement, workout) %&gt;% \n  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\nTable 2: Workout venue, by supplement use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupplement\nworkout\nn\n\n\n\n\nno\nHulk Power\n8\n\n\nno\nPlanet Fitness\n1037\n\n\nyes\nHulk Power\n949\n\n\nyes\nPlanet Fitness\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, it is associated with bench, as indicated by Figure 2 below:\n\nvitamin_data %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = workout, y = bench)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"burlywood\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Boxplots of bench-press weight, by workout venue.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo workout is associated with supplement, and associated with bench. If it were actually part of what causes bench, then it would be a confounding factor.\nRealizing that workout could be a confounding factor, the statisticians decide to control for it, by including it in their visualizations and their models.\nFor a visualization, they might make something like Figure 3:\n\nvitamin_data %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = supplement, y = bench)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"burlywood\") +\n  facet_grid(. ~ workout)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Boxplots of bench-press weight by supplement use, for the two workout venues, in the observational study.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith linear models, they control by adding in the possible confounder:\n\nmod2 &lt;- lm(bench ~ supplement + workout, data = vitamin_data)\nsummary(mod2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = bench ~ supplement + workout, data = vitamin_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-64.317 -10.316  -0.159  10.526  58.643 \n\nCoefficients:\n                      Estimate Std.
